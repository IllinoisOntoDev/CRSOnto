# Community Ties Ontology

## Employment Status

(or whatever similar terms are available from the employment ontology)

## relationship status
- in a relationship (married/significant other)

## student status
- student (student from EMPLOYMENT *OR* attends non-local school from SCHOOL *OR* student from OCCUPATION)

## age

## level of education

- past charges
    + import charge ontology
